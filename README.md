Personal Web Design Porfolio

This project is a portfolio website to display my current and future projects.

At the top of the page you will see my name and navigation links to the various sections of my page. These links are equipped with CSS attributes that animate when hovered over to keep the static webpage more interesting.

Below that you will find my Hero banner, which displays a current picture of me and a short phrase informing visitors I prefer to go by JD and not Jesse.

The next section contains my current and future projects, many of the images are just placeholders right now, but will be updated as more projects are completed. Like the navigation elements, these animate when hovered over.

The final section is the footer and contact section. This displays my current phone number, business e-mail, GitHub link, and LinkedIn profile link, all of which can be clicked on and will navigate the user the their respective pages.
